NOTE:

- i2c devices have a chance of IO, physical bus errors,
  SO BE SURE TO WRITE TRY CATCH WRAPPERS around functions
  to ensure main routine does not crash if an i2c device
  goes down!!
  + happens when handling, wear rubber gloves when assembling?
  + esd protection

BNO055:
- does not seem to be calibrating when in AMG_MODE
